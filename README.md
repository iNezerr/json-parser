# Build Your Own JSON Parser Challenge üöÄ

## Overview  

In this project, I'll be tackling the **Build Your Own JSON Parser** challenge. The goal is to create a JSON parser from scratch to learn about lexical and syntactic analysis‚Äîconcepts fundamental to parsing data formats and even building compilers. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, widely-used data-interchange format, making it a perfect candidate for this challenge.

### Why a JSON Parser?  
- It offers hands-on experience with **lexical analysis** (tokenizing input) and **syntactic analysis** (validating against JSON grammar).  
- It's a great way to deepen my understanding of **parsing techniques** and handling **structured data**.  
- Collaboration with others will allow me to learn from different problem-solving approaches and perspectives.

## Challenge Steps  

### Step 0: Environment Setup  
1. Choose your favorite IDE/editor and programming language.  
2. Download test data (link provided in Slack).  
3. Ensure you have a working test setup for automated testing.  

### Step 1: Parsing Basic JSON Objects  
- **Goal**: Parse `{}` and report validity.  
- **Output**:  
  - `0` for valid JSON  
  - `1` for invalid JSON  
- **Testing**: Use the files in `tests/step1`.  

### Step 2: Parsing Key-Value Pairs  
- **Goal**: Parse JSON with string keys and values, e.g., `{"key": "value"}`.  
- **Testing**: Use the files in `tests/step2`.  

### Step 3: Handling Various Data Types  
- **Goal**: Support strings, numbers, booleans, and null, e.g.:  
  ```json
  {
    "key1": true,
    "key2": false,
    "key3": null,
    "key4": "value",
    "key5": 101
  }
  ```  
- **Testing**: Use the files in `tests/step3`.  

### Step 4: Nested Objects and Arrays  
- **Goal**: Support nested objects and arrays, e.g.:  
  ```json
  {
    "key": "value",
    "key-n": 101,
    "key-o": {},
    "key-l": []
  }
  ```  
- **Testing**: Use the files in `tests/step4`.  

### Step 5: Custom Tests  
- **Goal**: Add custom tests for edge cases and error handling.  
- **Outcome**: Ensure robust parsing with meaningful error messages.
